# Artificial-Life

Author: David Jordan

A program that simulates artificial life through natural selection.

Heavily based on PolyWorld by Larry Yaeger (1994)

The project is built with Visual Studio 2013 to run on Windows machines

NOTE: the program does run slow currently, because it needs to render the scene from each agent's perspective (to give them vision). I will eventually try to speed this up somehow.
